# UX_UI_HW_17

This is the site I'm building for U of U UX/UI Bootcamp. Going to learn how to code html, css with flexbox etc.

The requirements were to build an portfolio page from a wirefram layout.

I finalized it with Bootstrap html/css. 

To achive the design, I customized the CSS to override some Bootstrap defaults.

A seciondary goal was to have a site that would preform close to 100 as possible in Google Developer tools Lighthouse

The final site was this: https://marklapoint-uxui.com/index.html
